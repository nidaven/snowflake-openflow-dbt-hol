-- stg_risk_assess_customers
--
-- Customer dimension for the credit risk star. 250 rows.
--
-- GOVERNANCE NOTE
-- The source has a `customer_name` column. It does not appear below.
--
-- In this particular data set the values are persona labels ("Stable Prime
-- Customer") rather than real names, so nothing here is actually identifying.
-- It is excluded anyway, for two reasons. First, a column called customer_name
-- in a customer table is a name field until someone proves otherwise, and the
-- default has to be exclude-then-justify rather than the other way round.
-- Second, everything downstream of this model eventually reaches an AI agent,
-- and an agent will happily read a name column out loud to whoever asked.
--
-- Where the business genuinely needs to join on identity without seeing it, a
-- one-way hash is the usual answer, and `customer_name_hash` below is that.
-- It is stable, it joins, and it cannot be read back.
