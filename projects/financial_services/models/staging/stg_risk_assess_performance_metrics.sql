-- stg_risk_assess_performance_metrics
--
-- Pre-aggregated performance fact, one row per source performance record.
-- 700 rows, the same row count as the risk profiles.
--
-- Note what this table is: numbers somebody else already aggregated. It is
-- convenient and it is also a trap, because nothing in it can be recomputed
-- from the monthly assessments without knowing exactly what window the source
-- used. It is carried through and used, but the mart keeps it in its own
-- columns rather than mixing it with figures this project calculates itself.
