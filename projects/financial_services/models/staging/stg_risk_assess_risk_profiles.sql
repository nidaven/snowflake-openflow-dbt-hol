-- The relationship fact: one row per source risk profile. 700 rows.
--
-- Three columns here look numeric and are not: collateral_quality_score,
-- liquidity_ratio and projected_cash_flow_rating are text in the source. The
-- current seed values are populated and parseable, but try_cast keeps future
-- blanks or malformed values from taking the whole model down. Unparseable
-- values become NULL so downstream models can handle "unknown" explicitly.
