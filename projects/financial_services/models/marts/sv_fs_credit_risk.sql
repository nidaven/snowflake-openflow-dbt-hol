-- sv_fs_credit_risk
--
-- A Snowflake Semantic View over the credit risk star.
--
-- Two logical tables, joined on the relationship key: the monthly time series
-- and the relationship summary that carries the conformed dimensions. That
-- join is what lets Cortex Analyst answer "how did risk trend for high net
-- worth customers at credit unions in the Midwest" without anyone writing SQL.
--
-- Governance note. Every column exposed here comes from a mart with an
-- enforced contract, and no personal data reaches either of those marts. That
-- is not a coincidence, it is the design: an AI agent will describe whatever
-- it is given, so the control has to sit upstream of the semantic layer, not
-- inside it. See models/staging/stg_loan.sql.
--
-- Compare with the `semantic_model:` and `metrics:` blocks in
-- _financial_services__marts.yml, which express the same ideas as dbt Semantic
-- Layer (MetricFlow) specs.
